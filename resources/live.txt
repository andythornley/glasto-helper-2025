Your Responsibility
You are booking a general admission ticket deposit. This means that you will pay just £75.00 per admission ticket now.
All ticket balances will be payable in the first week of April 2025 from 09:00 BST Tuesday 1st April - 23:59 BST Monday 7th April 2025 when it should be possible to add car parking passes and cancellation protection to your booking.
If you have not paid your balance by the end of the balance payment window, or you decide to cancel your deposit, you will be charged an administration fee of £25.00 per ticket and refunded £50.00 per ticket. You will be sent a reminder email when the deadline is approaching. However, ultimately, you are responsible for paying your ticket balance.
